## Usage

Following are some ways through which you can access the paypal provider:

```php
// Import the class namespaces first, before using it directly
use Amorphine\CardPayGo\Services\HostedForm;

$provider = new HostedForm;

// Through facade. No need to import namespaces
$provider = CardPayGo::setProvider('hosted_form');      // To use express hosted form(used by default).

$provider->addFormOptions($order_model->getCardPayGoData()); // add more form options like amount etc.

$data = $provider->getFormData(); // get array of form data you can use the way you like. F.e. you can render it as html-form to be submitted

```
